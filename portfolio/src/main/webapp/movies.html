                <p class="paragraph">I used to not be a big fan of movies. They were too long and 
                    there was too much dialogue, and overall, I would rather read a book or use 
                    the internet. About a couple years ago though, I discovered a group of people
                    online who <i>really</i> liked movies. Collectively, they were called Film Twitter,
                    and yes they "stanned" entire movies. I became interested in filmmaking and storytelling.
                    I don't know how to make a movie, and of course I've never made one--but that's not going
                    to stop me from giving my opinion that no one asked for.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">I've been in quarantine since March... so let's just say I've had a lot of
                    free time. I've watched A LOT of movies since then, and I've started keeping track 
                    of all the ones that I watch, and sometimes even writing short little reviews on my 
                    Twitter. Here is a list of some of my favorite movies that I've watched while being 
                    quarantined.

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Pitch Perfect</strong><br>Don't judge me, okay. I was in need of a laugh, and Pitch Perfect is a CLASSIC comedy. The
                    music is *chef's kiss*. I remember when I was younger, I learned the choreography - this movie was iconic when I was a pre-teen. This is the Mean 
                    Girls of my generation, and it still holds up 8 years later!<br><br>7/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Bumblebee</strong><br>Never watched a Transformers movie, but this was actually very enjoyable. I'd never thought
                    I'd find a yellow VW beetle so cute but they did a great job with the CGI. In regards to the acting, WOW Hailee Steinfeld never disappoints.
                    I would recommend if only for the cute car.<br><br>7/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Booksmart</strong><br>Okay, so I love this movie because it's equal parts absolutely ridiculous and relatable. It
                    is so FUNNNY and the humor is pretty close to what you can expect from high schoolers in today's age. George actually reminds me of a friend I 
                    had in high school, so I can't help but laugh whenever he's on screen. For OLivia Wilde's directorial debut, this is a pretty solid film.<br><br>8/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Dickinson</strong><br>I know it's not technically a movie, but it's such a great show, I had to include it
                    in the list. Dickinson is based on the life of... well Emily Dickinson, but with modern language and elements. The concept of this show shouldn't 
                    work, but it does, and it does it so well. It's really cool to see a 19th century poet come to life in a way that we as a modern society can 
                    understand, and also it's VERY funny.<br><br>8/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>The Edge of Seventeen</strong><br>It's not my first time watching it, but this movie is still so funny. I've
                    been on a bit of a Hailee Steinfeld binge, but she's seriously SO GOOD at playing these awkward, funny, yet complex teenage roles. Really great
                    coming-of-age movie and super hilarious.<br><br>8/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Arrival</strong><br>I'd been wanting to watch this movie for awhile, so I had very high expectations. I'm happy to say 
                    this movie met most of them. I say most because this was a very different type of alien movie than what I was expecting--in a good way. The story is 
                    great, and the linguistics stuff is super interesting. The cinematography is also just beautiful.<br><br>9/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>True Grit</strong><br>I really did not think that I would like this movie this much. I'm definitely not a Western 
                    movie fan, but I only watched because people kept talking about how great it was. This movie is great. The dialogue is so rich, but it's still 
                    funny to a modern audience. The cast is amazing. Jeff Bridges NAILS this role (believe me as someone from the South). Also, a 13 year-old Hailee
                    Steinfeld was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and it's easy to see why. And yes this movie started off the Hailee Steinfeld binge.<br><br>9/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Lady Bird</strong><br>I rewatched this movie, and since the first time I watched it, I knew it was one of
                    my FAVORITE movies. It's a more relatable coming-of-age movie than most, and it's also very funny (also as a Catholic, I liked the niche 
                    humor and references lol). Lady Bird shows a side of the American high school experience that is rarely seen, but that many (including myself)
                    can relate to.<br><br>10/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Parasite</strong><br>I know I'm late to the Parasite bandwagon but WOW this movie is seriously so good.
                    You could watch it several times and see it in a new light each time. Bong Joon Ho REALLY deserved those Oscars. The symbolism is *chef's
                    kiss*<br><br>10/10</p>

                    <p class="movie-caption"><strong>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</strong><br>I know I said Lady Bird was one of my favorite films, but I think
                    this actually tops it. I've rewatched it a few times, and I am still in awe of the AMAZING, INNOVATIVE animation. Seriously, I was giddy in the
                    theater watching this movie, and I don't consider myself a comic book fan by any means. As if the animation, direction, voice talent, and story
                    weren't enough to already make this an amazing film, the score is just WOW.<br><br>10/10 (wish I could give it more)</p>
