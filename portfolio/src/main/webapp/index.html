            <p class="paragraph">Hi! My name is Valeria, and this is my portfolio page. I am currently a STEP intern at Google
            for the summer of 2020. I attend Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, and I am a second-year student
            studying computer science. In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows. I don't like to 
            pick favorites, <i>but</i> if I had to, it'd probably be Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (or 
            Lady Bird I don't know).
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">My Movie Recs</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I currently have a running thread on Twitter on the movies I've watched while in quarantine, but
                I also created a short little list of some of my favorites that I've seen. If you're looking to kill your boredom,
                this is a good start!
            </p>

            <div class="btn-container">
                <a href="movies.html"><button class="btn">Movie List →</button></a>
            </div>

            <!-- <p class="paragraph">Click here to get a random movie that I've seen since quarantine (I've had a lot of time):</p>
            <button class="paragraph" onclick="addRandomGreeting()">Get a movie</button>
            <div id="greeting-container"></div> -->

            <h2 class="heading">Mikey Gallery</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Anybody that knows me knows how much I love my dog, Mikey. My family's had him since
                I was nine years old, so Mikey's been in my life for a majority of the time that I've been alive. The 
                thing about Mikey is that he isn't like a <i>normal</i> dog. I highly recommend you check out
                the image gallery of Mikey to understand what I'm talking about.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">Shameless Plugs</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">If you wanna check out some of my projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">U-Reach: If you're a college student in Georgia, this is the webapp for you.
                    U-Reach allows you to connect with other students on your campus who share the same 
                    interests as you. Reach us at <a class="project-links" href="http://www.u-reach.appspot.com">u-reach.appspot.com.</a>
                </li><br>
                <li class="list">Vote it, poll it!: Made during a very political season, this webapp was made to 
                    make it easier for people to be involved in our democracy. During election season,
                    you'll get a rundown of what's on your ballot and resources to help you get to know
                    each candidate. Check it out at <a class="project-links" href="http://www.vote-it-poll-it.appspot.com">vote-it-poll-it.appspot.com.</a>
                </li><br>
                <li class="list">PlayShare: I always say PlayShare is my brainchild because it was the first project I
                    designed, coded, and built all by myself. If you love music, but you're sick of hearing the 
                    same old playlist, PlayShare will allow you to create random playlists based around a theme.
                    You can also share your playlists, so that others can see what you're listening to. Music 
                    sharing is at your fingertips at <a class="project-links" href="https://my-playshare.appspot.com">my-playshare.appspot.com.</a>
