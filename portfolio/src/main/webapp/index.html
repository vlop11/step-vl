        <p>Hi! My name is Valeria, and this is my portfolio page. I am currently a STEP intern at Google
          for the summer of 2020. I attend Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, and I am a second-year student
          studying computer science. In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows. I don't like to 
          pick favorites, <i>but</i> if I had to, it'd probably be Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (or 
          Lady Bird I don't know).
        </p>
        
        <p>Click here to get a random movie that I've seen since quarantine (I've had a lot of time):</p>
