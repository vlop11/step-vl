        <h1>Valeria's Portfolio</h1>

        <p>Hi! My name is Valeria, and this is my portfolio page. I am currently a STEP intern at Google
          for the summer of 2020. I attend Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, and I am a second-year student
          studying computer science. In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows. I don't like to 
          pick favorites, <i>but</i> if I had to, it'd probably be Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (or 
          Lady Bird I don't know).
        </p>
        
        <p>Click here to get a random movie that I've seen since quarantine (I've had a lot of time):</p>

        <p>If you wanna check out some of my projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>U-Reach: If you're a college student in Georgia, this is the webapp for you.
                U-Reach allows you to connect with other students on your campus who share the same 
                interests as you. Reach us at u-reach.appspot.com
            </li>
            <li>Vote it, poll it!: Made during a very political season, this webapp was made to 
                make it easier for people to be involved in our democracy. During election season,
                you'll get a rundown of what's on your ballot and resources to help you get to know
                each candidate. Check it out at vote-it-poll-it.appspot.com.
            </li>
            <li>PlayShare: I always say PlayShare is my brainchild because it was the first project I
                designed, coded, and built all by myself. If you love music, but you're sick of hearing the 
                same old playlist, PlayShare will allow you to create random playlists based around a theme.
                You can also share your playlists, so that others can see what you're listening to. Music 
                sharing is at your fingertips at my-playshare.appspot.com.
