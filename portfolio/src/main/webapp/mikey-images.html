                I am not ashamed. Mikey is ugly. Just accept this fact of life. Mikey is 
                ugly, it's cute. He does gross, weird things. Sometimes he's very annoying,
                but it's fine. Regardless, he's a HILARIOUS dog. You could literally
                just watch him (and we have) and still be entertained. Have fun looking
                at Mikey at his best (worst?) moments!
