            <p class="paragraph">Alright I'll just come out and say it... because
            I am not ashamed. Mikey is ugly. Just accept this fact of life. Mikey is 
            ugly, it's cute. He does gross, weird things. Sometimes he's very annoying,
            but it's fine. Regardless, he's a HILARIOUS dog. You could literally
            just watch him (and we have) and still be entertained. Have fun looking
            at Mikey in his best (worst?) moments!
